Welcome to Lord

This a conceptual container orchestrator. Its aims are to test new and more efficient ways of communication among nodes, alternative forms of persistence and whatever else seems exciting.

It's now in its early stages of development and its main conceiver, ideologist, curator, administrator, guru and f√ºhrer is Gabriel Fernandez. This is an open project though and all ideas will be apreciated. If you take a taste for it, administration will merily welcome you to colaborate and help making those difficult decisions.

Feel free to redistribute, copy, alter, come up with a private product that steals its code and anything else you wish to do, except for patent it, since, once again, this is a public project aimed to help the general community to learn and deal with containerization of applications.
